					<p>Having graduated from college, Cass was in desperate need of a job. He lived with his parents, who constantly reminded him that his life was going nowhere --  a fact that he was fully aware of. 
			            Eventually he got desperate and responded to a seedy job offer, unwittingly selling his soul and becoming a maid for witches, ghouls, ghosts, and everthing you’ve ever feared.</p>
					
					<p>Whether he’s good or not at his job is up to you.</p>

								<p>Keep the guests of the mansion satisfied with spiritual offerings and accommodations. If you neglect just one guest, they will become agitated and wreak havoc. If Cass’s health reaches 0 before the end of the night<strong>...</strong>well let's just say he got fired.</p>

							<div id="exampleAccordion2" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
								<p>Séance features a Doom-esque health “bar” in its UI. The goal was to have something a little more fun than a standard health bar by paying homage to an earlier classic in Doom’s health bar. Let’s call it a health face. Cass’s face represents his state: the less health he has, the more ragged his health face becomes, eventually becoming withered and pale in complexion. This gave users a visual cue that could give as much information as a normal health bar, in addition for it being fun for us to implement. In sum, this really puts the “face” in “interface”. 
				                  	The health face provides a good base for other UI elements to be placed around it. The player’s resources, cycle count, and time until the next cycle can all be seen at a glance in the upper-left corner.
				                  	The player also has the ability to zoom in and out, allowing for a player to choose between zooming in to see the details of the map or zooming out to get a bigger, strategic picture.</p>

								<p>Much of the strategic layer of Séance lies in the implications of residents and their neighbors. Because certain residents have a certain affinity or aversion to other residents, the player must learn about their guests to truly master the game. Moving residents to different rooms, getting rid of the high-threat monsters, and general map awareness can go a long way in the haunted mansion.</p>

								<p>Monster all have a global agitation gain of 1 every 5 seconds. When monsters reach max agitation as specified by their unique entity attributes, they will go on a rampage and cause neighboring monsters, within the agitated monster’s area of effect to rapidly gain agitation. Furthermore, this area of effect will also affect the Player’s health if the Player stands for too long inside the area. Of the Player’s total health pool of 100, each second reduces the Player’s health by 25.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Witch</h3>
									
									<p>A strange shut-in.</p>
									
									<p>She doesn’t like people coming into her room unannounced. Although she keeps to herself and typically won’t bother others, much of her time is spent thinking of nasty spells and hexes that she won’t hesitate to cast if disturbed.</p>
									
									<p>Because of her great arcane prowess, nearby neighbors can be affected by her spells as well, agitating them in turn.</p>
									
									<p>Due to her mature nature, she doesn’t get along with the ghost because she views their kind as very childish. With that said, she has a lot more patience than Frankenstein because she is used to dealing with 
					                    such behavior.</p>

								<div class="slide_content-text text-center">
									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Frankenstein</h3>
									
									<p>A docile giant who doesn’t mind sound and is a flexible neighbor.</p>
									
									<p>No, really, he’s actually quite limber, but he’s also flexible in the sense that he gets along with most others. However, he has a larger than average diet and will go on a rampage, breaking down neighbors’ doors if left unattended to the point of agitation.</p>
									
									<p>Frankenstein’s ease of placement, for example, he gets along with all neighbors, provides the player with a sort of “free” guest. The player does not have to worry about him getting along with others. He does, however, require the player to keep track of their resources to make sure they have enough food for him before he gets angry and starts becoming a problem.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Ghost</h3>
									
									<p>No one ghost is alike, just like people -- they were people at one point after all. Some have annoyingly particular accommodations and some are fine with anything. Their behavior upon agitation will vary.</p>
									
									<p>Since every ghost is different, their game behavior will vary as well. Some of this behaviors are their speed, and maximum agitation. In addition, they are one of the faster monsters in the game. A similarity between the ghosts and the witches is that they both are not quite fond with each other, i.e. their agitation increase rate would be greater when they are neighbors. Unlike the witch, however, their maximum agitation is less than the witch to represent their childish and impatient nature.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Dracula</h3>
									
									<p>A surprisingly easy-going guy for someone so bloodthirsty. He’s a very particular eater, but generally easy to accommodate. However, he’ll attack his neighbors (and you) for blood upon agitation, which is usually caused by not feeding him. Dracula will also get a bit stronger every time he kills something, so watch out!</p>
									
									<p>Dracula will get stronger if he kills another resident. This design necessitates that players keep track of him before he becomes overpoweringly strong. While having Dracula as a guest can be harrowing, it is balanced out by the fact that he is, for the most part, easy to accommodate. As long as the player can remain cognizant of his appetite, the player can certainly tend to other guests while appeasing Dracula. One may even want to let Dracula to kill another guest rather than using a silver bullet, keeping in mind that he could just as easily kill the player if he or she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Bloody Mary</h3>
									
									<p>A polite and considerate guest. Doesn’t eat much and doesn’t make too much of a fuss. Her bleeding head tends to make a mess periodically, though. Upon agitation she will go insane and start haunting her neighbors, making them go insane as well.</p>
									
									<p>While she is similar to Frankenstein in that she doesn’t hate her neighbors and vice versa, the difference lies in the fact that her neighbors gets irritated because of the mess she makes. This places power in the player’s hands, as long as he/she remembers to manage the mess once in awhile. However, once she reaches maximum agitation, she automatically puts her neighbors’ agitation to maximum. With that said, her agitation cap is the highest in the game so it would take awhile for her and her neighbors to go insane. This makes Bloody Mary a sort of ticking time-bomb, being forgiving for most of the game, but causing massive problems if left unattended.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Werewolf</h3>
									
									<p>The legendary, fearsome beast that appears in every fantasy-themed world. In this game he’s an obnoxious guest with a ravenous appetite. His random howling during the night, can disturb other guests, and he sheds profusely. The werewolf doesn’t care much for cleanliness, but his neighbors might take offense to it in addition to the uproar he creates with his howls. Upon agitation he’ll go eat the first thing he sees.</p>
									
									<p>The werewolf’s behavior changes through the night. He initially starts as a human, where his speed and maximum agitation is average, closely resembling the witches behavior. However, in a random time in the night, he will transform into a werewolf for a short period of time. In this state, his behavior changes drastically, he constantly makes a mess, and howls agitating every neighbors, which agitates him as well. In addition, his maximum agitation will be cut in half in this frenzy state.</p>

									<h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Davy Jones</h3>
									
									<p>A spirit of few words and even fewer hands. This hook-wielding buccaneer lost his life at sea and washed ashore here. He doesn’t get along well with people who make loud noises. The sea water that flows from his locker can fill up his room if left unattended (not that he minds), but just be careful when you open it to tend to him since it’ll all spill out and can get other residents wet.</p>
									
									<p>The messiest out of the bunch. His room is constantly filled with water and if left unattended, the water will eventually leak to his neighbor's room. This leakage will agitate the surrounding monsters and their agitation increase rate will slowly increase if water continues to leak through. His seawater can clean messes though, so the player can use their discretion when trying to leverage this unique mechanic. Davy Jones does not get agitated too often, unless the werewolf starts howling or the player stayed in his room for a long time. Sudden explosions coming from the witch’s room can also set him off. Since he is the oldest, most elderly monster, his movement is very slow and his maximum agitation is one of the higher ones in the game.</p>
